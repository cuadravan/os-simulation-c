## Description
This repository contains the code I developed for our Operating Systems course.  

1. **Classic CPU Scheduling Algorithms**  
   Implemented in C using linked lists for process management.  
   - Each process is represented as a node.  
   - Processes are transferred between **Ready Queue**, **Job Queue**, and **Termination Queue** for realistic simulation.
   - Each algorithm differs in how they prioritize, halt, and execute the processes.   

2. **Synchronization Problems (Dining Philosopher & Producer-Consumer)**  
   Implemented in C using semaphores and multithreading.  
   - **Multithreading** simulates multiple simultaneous processes in a computer.  
   - **Semaphores** simulate how processes "lock" and coordinate access to shared resources.  

## Features
- Simulation of major **CPU scheduling algorithms**.  
- Demonstration of **concurrency issues** and solutions.  
- Practical use of **linked lists**, **multithreading**, and **semaphores**.
